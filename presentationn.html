This is a presentation
regular expression:

regular expression represents a text pattern

reserved characters:
.  represents any char
* reepresents 0 or more
   e.g,    [0]*   matches  0000000000
+ represents 1 or more
? represents 0 or 1     [0]?   str=",str1='0'
     "3.00".replace(/\.[0]*/,");
$  representss the end of string
^  (usage1) represents the beginning of the string
    (usage2) represents NOT,used inside square bracket[]

  better write:
    "3.00".replace(/[\.][0]*$/,");  delete only zeros at tail,but not
   in the middle

  "abcd".replace(/bc/,")   deletes bc
  but     "abcd".replacee(/^bc/,") does not delete bc
  ^b  means leading b

  [^b] means NOT b

  "ac".replace(/^[^b]/,'x') ---->  "Xc", but
  "bc".replace(/^[^b]/,'x') does not match
\s    empty space, \t
\d    digits
[0-9]  digits
[a-z]    lower alphabets
[A-Z]   a capital letter

()    stores matchs stringg and to be used later in replacing
      "xyz12*?3.5sdsd".replace(/([a-z]+)(.*)/([a-z]+)/, '$1$2');
      holds more characters to be  matched at least one
      [0-9]  [0123456789]
      "a".replace(/[0-9]/, ") --------> "a"
      "a1a".replace(/a[0-9]a/, ") ---------> ""
      (sounds "pipe"), means logical OR
[a|b|d]   matches a or b or d

{}     specifies number of occurances:
       [a-z]{6}     means     6 letters

In Javascript, use RegExp class/function to create a regular expression,
       let r = new RegExp(/\n[0-9]/g);

   let text = "\n\n\n1.ancw\n\n\n\www\n2.fgfgfgf\n\n\n3 dd";
